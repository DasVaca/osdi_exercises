Q1. 
What are the two main functions of an os?
A1. 
Provide abstraction to the user/programmer (from hardware) and
managing resources.


Q2.
What is the difference between kernel mode and user mode?
Why is the difference important to an os?
A2.
A program running on kernel mode has direct access to the hardware,
on the other hand user mode programs have to request the kernel for such operations.
...


Q3.
What is multiprogramming?
A3.
Loading multiple programs so that if one is on an operation
that does not require cpu time then another programms 
could execute without having to change tapes or unload the
previous program, this was achieved partitionating the computer disk/memory 
(so that each programs has a designated space to work freely).


Q4.
What is spooling? 
Do you think that advanced pc will have spooling as standard feature in the future?
A4.
The ability to read jobs (from tapes/cards) onto the computer disk so they can 
be used as soon as another jobs ends.
I am in the future, so answering now is kinda weird.


Q5. On early computers, every byte of data read or written was directly handled
by the CPU (i.e. there was no Direct Memory Access).
What implications does this organization have for multiprogramming?
A5.
Multiprogramming could not be achieve efficently because a program requesting 
to read/write a file (wich most programs do) would constantly needs cpu time.


Q6.
Why was timesharing not widespread on 2nd-gen computers?
A6.
The risk to lose a day of work was to high, since programmers didn't have
the machine for themselves they couldn't debug the programs on runtime, 
therefore they have to wait until the results were given by the batch people.


Q7.
Which of the following instructions should be allowed only in kernel mode?
a) Disable all interrupts
b) Read the time-of-day clock
c) Set the time-of-day clock
d) Change the memory map
A7.
All of them.


Q8.
List some differences between pc os and mainframe os.
A8.


Q9. 
Give one reason why a closed-source propietary system like Windows 
should have better quality than open-source os like Linux; and viceversa.
A9.


Q10.
A MINIX file whose owner has UID=12 and GID=1 has mode 
rwxr-x---
Another user with UID=6 and GID=1 tries to execute the file.
What will happen?
A10.
I will execute the file because they are in the same group.


Q11.
A11.
